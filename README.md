### Heroes of the Storm Automated Replay Spectator

I developed an automated replay spectator project for Heroes of the Storm, which streamed on Twitch 24/7 with Twitch Chat integration. This project utilized several technologies to ensure seamless operation and interaction:

- **AWS S3** for storing and retrieving replay files
- **Twitch API** for integrating chat functionalities and stream control
- **Heroes Profile API** for fetching game statistics and player data
- **Native Windows OCR** for coordinating hero selection during streams

Code can be found at [Heroes Replay](https://github.com/HeroesReplay)

This project was streamed on the SaltySadism Twitch channel, providing an interactive and continuous viewing experience for the community.
